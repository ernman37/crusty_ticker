Thank you for your interest in contributing to crusty_ticker! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [cargo-llvm-cov](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov) (for coverage testing)

### Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ernman37/crusty_ticker.git
   cd crusty_ticker
   ```
3. Add the upstream remote:

   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching

- Create a feature branch from `main`:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- Use descriptive commit messages:
- Use descriptive branch names:

### Making Changes

1. Write your code
2. Add or update tests
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Run the checks (see below)

### Before Submitting

Run all checks locally:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check coverage (should be ≥95%)
cargo llvm-cov
```

## Code Style

### Formatting

- Use `cargo fmt` to format code
- Use `cargo clippy` to catch common mistakes

### Documentation

- All public items must have doc comments
- Include examples in doc comments where helpful
- Use `///` for item documentation
- Use `//!` for module-level documentation

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Place unit tests in the `tests/` directory
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain minimum 95% code coverage

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub

4. **PR Requirements**:
   - Clear description of changes
   - All CI checks passing
   - Code coverage ≥95%
   - Documentation updated (if applicable)
